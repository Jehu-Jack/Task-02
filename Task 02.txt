  1.write a blog on the Difference between document & window objects?

        The Document object represents the content and structure of the current web page, 
        while the Window object represents the browser window or tab itself. The Document 
        object is limited to the content of the current web page and is accessed using the
        document property, while the Window object encompasses the entire browser window or
        tab and is accessed using the window property or the global object window. Changes
        made to the Document object only affect the current web page,while changes made to 
        the Window object can impact the entire window or tab.
